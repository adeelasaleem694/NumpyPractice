# **NumPy Practice**

This repository contains my daily practice and exercises related to **NumPy**, focusing on understanding its features and applications in data manipulation and scientific computing.

## **Topics Covered**
1. **Introduction to NumPy**
   - What is NumPy?
   - Difference between lists and NumPy arrays.
2. **Creating NumPy Arrays**
   - 1D, 2D, 3D, and higher-dimensional arrays.
   - Array initialization with zeros, ones, and random values.
3. **Array Indexing and Slicing**
   - Accessing elements and subarrays.
   - Conditional filtering.
4. **Array Operations**
   - Arithmetic operations.
   - Broadcasting and reshaping arrays.
5. **Aggregate Functions**
   - Mean, median, standard deviation, and sum.
6. **Linear Algebra with NumPy**
   - Dot products and matrix multiplication.
7. **Advanced Concepts**
   - Stacking and splitting arrays.
   - Working with NumPy's `arange` and `linspace`.

## **Requirements**
