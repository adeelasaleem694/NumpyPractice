# NumPy Basics

This project documents my learning journey with **NumPy**, a powerful Python library for numerical computations. Below is a summary of key concepts and examples that I explored.

## Concepts Covered:

1. **What is NumPy?**
   - NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for working with arrays and matrices, providing high-performance operations on large datasets.

2. **Difference Between Lists and NumPy Arrays**
   - NumPy arrays are more efficient for numerical operations and consume less memory compared to Python lists.

3. **NumPy Array Creation**
   - Explored the creation of:
     - 1D arrays
     - 2D arrays
     - 3D arrays
     - Higher-dimensional arrays

4. **Practical Examples:**
   - Creating arrays with `numpy.array()`
   - Generating arrays using `numpy.zeros()`, `numpy.ones()`, `numpy.arange()`, and `numpy.linspace()`
   - Reshaping arrays with `numpy.reshape()`


## Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Python**
- **NumPy**

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install NumPy using `pip install numpy` if not already installed.
3. Run the Python script to see the outputs of various array operations.

## Learning Goals:
- Continue practicing NumPy operations alongside Python and Pandas.
- Share daily progress and code on GitHub to track learning milestones.
